# Security Labs Portfolio

This repository serves as a central index for my hands-on cybersecurity labs.  
Each lab is documented in its own repository and focuses on **analyst reasoning, telemetry validation, and investigative decision-making**, not just tool output.

## SOC & Detection Labs

### Lab 01 – Endpoint Telemetry Validation Using Sysmon and Microsoft Defender

## About This Portfolio

These labs are designed to reflect how a SOC analyst or detection engineer:

- Validates telemetry pipelines  
- Investigates blocked vs executed activity  
- Correlates endpoint artifacts  
- Documents assumptions, pivots, and findings  

The emphasis is on **how I think through security problems**, not just the final result.
